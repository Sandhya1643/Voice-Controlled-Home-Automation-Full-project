# Voice-Controlled-Home-Automation-Full-project
Project Overview
The system uses voice recognition to control home appliances like lights, fans, and other devices. It typically integrates with Google Assistant, Alexa, or an offline voice recognition module.

Key Components
Microcontroller (Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32, Raspberry Pi)
Voice Recognition Module (e.g., Google Assistant, Alexa, or an offline module like Elechouse V3)
Relay Module (to switch AC appliances on/off)
Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266/ESP32 for IoT-based control)
Smartphone or Computer (for voice processing)
Power Supply (5V for the microcontroller, 230V for appliances)
Project Implementation
1. Voice Recognition Setup
Online Method (Google Assistant, Alexa)

Use IFTTT + Webhooks to connect voice commands to a cloud-based system (e.g., Firebase, MQTT).
The microcontroller listens to cloud commands and toggles relays.
Offline Method (Elechouse V3, EasyVR)

Train the module with specific voice commands (e.g., "Turn on light").
The module directly sends signals to the microcontroller.
2. Microcontroller & Relay Circuit
The microcontroller receives voice commands via Wi-Fi or serial communication.
Based on the command, it activates/deactivates the relay to control appliances.
3. IoT Integration (Optional)
Use Blynk, MQTT, or Firebase for mobile app control.
Sync IoT with voice control for a seamless smart home system.

  }
  Serial.println("Connected!");
}

void loop() {
  HTTPClient http;
  http.begin(client, ifttt_url);
  int httpCode = http.GET();

    Serial.println("Command Sent!");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Failed to send");
  }
  http.end();
  delay(5000);
}
Future Enhancements
Add AI-based voice processing for better recognition.
Integrate with home security (CCTV, door locks).
Develop a custom mobile app for hybrid control.
